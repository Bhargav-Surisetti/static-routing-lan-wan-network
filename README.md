# static-routing-lan-wan-network

This project demonstrates the configuration of an internetwork using **static routing**, involving 3 LANs and 3 WANs. It includes IP subnetting, router configurations, end-device setup, and verification of connectivity across the network.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔧 Built a network topology with **3 LANs** (10, 54, and 34 hosts) and **3 WAN links**.
- 🧠 Subnetted the given IP network `136.47.209.0/24` for efficient IP utilization.
- 💻 Configured routers, switches, and PCs using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- 📡 Enabled static routing for end-to-end communication between all LANs.
- 🔐 Secured Router R1 with **Telnet access** and password (`C!sc0`).
